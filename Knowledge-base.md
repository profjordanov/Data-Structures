# Array Data Structures
- Ordered
- Very lightweight
- Has a fixed size
- Usually built into the language
- Many collections are implemented by using arrays
- Arrays use a single block of memory

  Example: (Int32 uses 4 bytes)

  ```csharp
  int[] array = { 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 };
  ```
  Total: 5 * 4 bytes

- Uses total of array pointer + (N * element/pointer size)
- Array Address + (Element Index * Size) = Element Address
- Array Element Lookup â€“ O(1)
